Enter the number on the left to access your desired table. Next you will be asked to enter a property and its value. For instance, if you selected table 2, you might want to know the enthalpy and pressure of saturated water at 50 Â°C. Enter "temp" and 50, and you will obtain the results on the following format:

Note that, depending on your screen size, you may have to scroll back up a bit to view them, as the list of tables will be printed immediately after the results.

## Creating Your Own Tables
You may find that a table you need is not included in the repo. You can add a table yourself using the following steps:
* Add headers
    * table ID
    * table name
    * list of column names (properties)
    * list of units
    * list of multipliers (e.g. 1 or 1e-3)
* Add data

Below is an example:

## Using the GeneralTable class
The GeneralTable class can be used in scripts. This is especially useful when solving equations iteratively. Rather than provide an in depth documentation here, I would advise you to look in the exercises-folder to see how it has been implemented for various assignments.
